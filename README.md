> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is still in very early alpha. Bugs _will_ be present. Please help finding them, you can report any bugs on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kaVm8hGpne) or in the [repo issues](https://github.com/music-assistant/music-assistant-desktop/issues)

> [!WARNING]
> LOOKING FOR MAINTAINERS. The companion app is current very sparsly maintained. Any help is appreciated. Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file if you want to help.

## Setup

When starting the app for the first time you are asked about some information about the Music Assistant Server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app requires that the webserver is exposed. You can set that in the settings:

## Features

### [Squeezelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezelite)

Squeezelite comes embedded in the application. This allows playback of music to your computer. The player name will be the same as your computer name. You can change the name in Music Assistant settings. You can also toggle if you wish to enable squeezelite at all.

To allow playback to the companion app you have to enable the slimproto provider in the Music Assistant settings.

### [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to#so-what-is-it)

Like the Spotify app, the Music Assistant app can do Discord Rich Presence.

Example of Discord Rich Presence:
